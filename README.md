## Typeaway
This is a fun application that allows users to type on the screen, but if they don't continue to type then the text will fade away. This application is meant to help authors with writers block or any user with a flow of creativity. This application is also good for users that want to write someone to get it off their chest, but want to physically watch the memory fade away for their own sense of closure.

This applicaiton with created in one night by Alexander Besse. Although it holds a MIT License, please learn from the code and don't just steal it. Thank you.
